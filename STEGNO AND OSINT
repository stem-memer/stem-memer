If you are reading this congrats, you are on the right track or are you really????

Round 2 of Turing's Enigma combines elements of Steganography,Osint(a fancy word for stalking) and yeah my thinking stopped so putting etc.


Your to do list is as follows:
1.find the flag(something enclosed in brackets eg stem.ctf{this.is.a.flag} 
2.determine what the asset was
3.Email us at the new email (email used in round 1 will not be accepted)
4.Optional Surprise marking:
  I have hidden a file called "hidden.txt" somewhere in these files on github, find the contents of it and send them to the module head

Note:Email with all the above required tasks 

GOOD LUCK
